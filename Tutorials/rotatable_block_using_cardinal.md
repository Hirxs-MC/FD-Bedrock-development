> [!NOTE]
> üîß This is a tutorial in which you can make a rotating block using "traits", this in order for you to be able to support 1.21.20 for your block

## ‚ùì- Rotatable Blocks - Using only traits
In this tutorial i will teach you how to make a block face the player in 4 different positions, or as it is called:
- **__Cardinal direction__**
  - Can only rotate to 4 sides 
    - (example: furnace,bookshelf etc...)

## Requirements:
- It is necessary to create a block as a base, a block without much code, just basic stuff like geometry, texture, collision and more

- Use a program to edit json files like Visual Studio Code, Bridge, Note pad++,etc...
  - (Avoid using mam for this tutorial)

## Here begins the tutorial!
**1**. First prepare a basic code for a custom block, something like this:

![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1273381780078071869/1273381793881657374/image.png?ex=66be68b5&is=66bd1735&hm=a589d8b29638854d01dff135fcd60563c47211aaeddfeecf6ffca181149fa12e&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=479&height=498)

_____________________________________

**2**. Near the `identifier` and `menu_category` sections write `traits: {}`

  - What is this for? This is used to assign a placement direction to our block

_____________________________________

**3**. After you have added the "traits" section inside the **{ }** symbols you will have to write `"minecraft:placement_direction: {}"`, after that you will write again inside the **{ }** symbols and you will write 2 lines of code, one called `"enabled_states": []` and `"y_rotation_offset":`

- Enabled_states :
  - Inside this component you will write "minecraft:cardinal_direction" which has the function of making your block able to be rotated in 4 different directions (north, south, east and west)

- y_rotation_offset:
  - In this component you will write only 180, setting it to 180 will allow the block to face the player

```
			"traits": {
				"minecraft:placement_direction": {
					"enabled_states": [
						"minecraft:cardinal_direction"
					],
					"y_rotation_offset": 180
				}
			},
```

And that's it, this will activate the permutations of our block! By the way, now we will have to do that!

_____________________________________

**4**. Now you will write a section in our block called "permutations" this above or below the "components" section (as you like)

![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1273381780078071869/1273386812529840170/image.png?ex=66be6d62&is=66bd1be2&hm=f7f767fad4e073700aed78931c8d5f37f3c6b4bfe05581df2168b4836f393f02&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)

_____________________________________

**5**. Now it's time to set the states/permutations that our block will have so we can set the rotation of our block in-game

in this section we will write the following:

```
		"permutations": [
			{
				"condition": "q.block_state('minecraft:cardinal_direction') == 'north'",
				"components": {
					"minecraft:transformation": {
						"rotation": [
							0,
							0,
							0
						]
					}
				}
			},
			{
				"condition": "q.block_state('minecraft:cardinal_direction') == 'west'",
				"components": {
					"minecraft:transformation": {
						"rotation": [
							0,
							90,
							0
						]
					}
				}
			},
			{
				"condition": "q.block_state('minecraft:cardinal_direction') == 'south'",
				"components": {
					"minecraft:transformation": {
						"rotation": [
							0,
							180,
							0
						]
					}
				}
			},
			{
				"condition": "q.block_state('minecraft:cardinal_direction') == 'east'",
				"components": {
					"minecraft:transformation": {
						"rotation": [
							0,
							-90,
							0
						]
					}
				}
			}
		],
```

### In case you're wondering what each thing is for?
Well let's take as an example `"condition": "q.block_state('minecraft:cardinal_direction') == 'north'"` what this code does is assign a condition to our block such as if our block faces north as mentioned in the line of code `q.block_state('minecraft:cardinal_direction') == 'north'` it can execute a component such as 
```
					"minecraft:transformation": {
						"rotation": [
							0,
							0, // <--- The block will take rotation from this number, example: if set to 90 the block will rotate to the west position
							0
						]
					}
```
which is responsible for giving the rotation to our block either of the x,y,z coordinates

_____________________________________

### And that would be all! 
after having done everything right, your block will be able to turn wherever you look

that this can be assigned to blocks that have custom models, solid blocks and more
